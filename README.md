# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

# Social-Networking 

## Description
```
 I configured the server using Express.js and connected it to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. When the application is invoked, it starts the 
 
 server and establishes a connection to the MongoDB database, ensuring the models are synced.

 I implemented GET routes for fetching all users and thoughts. These routes are designed to retrieve data from the database and display it in a 
 
 formatted JSON. Testing these routes in postman confirms that the data is correctly fetched and formatted.

 I implemented API routes for creating (POST), updating (PUT), and deleting (DELETE) users and thoughts. Testing these routes in postman allows 
 
 for successfully manipulating the database entries as required.

  I created POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts and managing user friend lists. These routes enable adding new reactions or friends 
  
  and removing existing ones. Testing in postman confirms that reactions and friends are successfully managed in the database.
